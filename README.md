## What this is

This is not a website. It is a fully interactive portfolio built entirely in the terminal using Python and the `curses` standard library, hosted live on Oracle Cloud and accessible to anyone in the world via a single SSH command — no installation, no browser, nothing to set up.

Every screen, colour pair, layout decision, and ASCII illustration was written by hand. The design is intentional: raw, minimal, and tactile. It is the kind of thing you build not because it is practical, but because you enjoy the craft of it.

The experience includes a home screen with a large ASCII name block and portrait, an About section with a hand-drawn CRT computer, a Projects section with a detailed 3.5" floppy disk illustration, and a Contact section with a retro rotary phone — all navigable with the arrow keys or vim bindings.

---

## Try it

```sh
ssh portfolio@artjomjapins.site
```

That is all. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows (PowerShell, Git Bash, or WSL). No account, no key, no configuration required. Minimum recommended terminal size is **120 × 30** characters.

## Navigation & Stack

<table>

<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Navigation**

Once connected the interface is fully keyboard-driven — no mouse required.

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `↑` or `k` | Move selection up |
| `↓` or `j` | Move selection down |
| `Enter` | Open selected section |
| `Q` | Return to home or quit |

</td>
<td width="50%" valign="top">

**Stack**

| | |
|---|---|
| Language | Python 3 (stdlib only) |
| TUI | `curses` |
| Protocol | OpenSSH |
| Infrastructure | Oracle Cloud — Always Free |
| OS | Ubuntu 22.04 LTS |
| Process management | `systemd` |

## How it works

The server runs a locked-down SSH configuration on Oracle Cloud (Always Free tier). Incoming connections are dropped directly into the portfolio process via a `ForceCommand` directive — there is no shell access, no filesystem exposure, just the TUI. When you disconnect, the process exits cleanly.

```
your terminal  ──SSH──▶  Oracle Cloud VM  ──ForceCommand──▶  portfolio.py  ──▶  curses TUI
```

The entire application is a single Python file with no external dependencies. Everything — layout engine, colour system, ASCII art, navigation state — lives in `portfolio.py` and runs on the Python standard library alone.

---

## Running a local copy

If you want to preview the layout on your own machine:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zxrk/terminal-portfolio.git
cd terminal-portfolio
python3 portfolio.py
```

On Windows, run this inside WSL — `curses` is not natively available in the standard Windows Python distribution.
